## Installation

Clone the repository to the Claude agents directory:

```bash
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/wshobson/agents.git
```

The subagents will be automatically available to Claude Code once placed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory.

## Usage

### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code automatically selects the appropriate subagent based on task context and requirements. The system analyzes your request and delegates to the most suitable specialist.

### Explicit Invocation
Specify a subagent by name to use a particular specialist:

```
"Use code-reviewer to analyze the recent changes"
"Have security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"
```

## Usage Examples

### Code Quality & Security
```
code-reviewer: Analyze component for best practices
security-auditor: Check for OWASP compliance
tdd-orchestrator: Implement feature with test-first approach
performance-engineer: Profile and optimize bottlenecks
```

### Development & Architecture
```
backend-architect: Design authentication API
frontend-developer: Create responsive dashboard
graphql-architect: Design federated GraphQL schema
mobile-developer: Build cross-platform mobile app
```

### Infrastructure & Operations
```
devops-troubleshooter: Analyze production logs
cloud-architect: Design scalable AWS architecture
network-engineer: Debug SSL certificate issues
database-admin: Configure backup and replication
terraform-specialist: Write infrastructure modules
```

### Data & Machine Learning
```
data-scientist: Analyze customer behavior dataset
ai-engineer: Build RAG system for document search
mlops-engineer: Set up experiment tracking
ml-engineer: Deploy model to production
```

### Business & Documentation
```
business-analyst: Create metrics dashboard
docs-architect: Generate technical documentation
api-documenter: Write OpenAPI specifications
content-marketer: Create SEO-optimized content
```

## Multi-Agent Workflows

Subagents coordinate automatically for complex tasks. The system intelligently sequences multiple specialists based on task requirements.

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Feature Development**
```
"Implement user authentication"
→ backend-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor
```

**Performance Optimization**
```
"Optimize checkout process"
→ performance-engineer → database-optimizer → frontend-developer
```

**Production Incidents**
```
"Debug high memory usage"
→ incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → error-detective → performance-engineer
```

**Infrastructure Setup**
```
"Set up disaster recovery"
→ database-admin → database-optimizer → terraform-specialist
```

**ML Pipeline Development**
```
"Build ML pipeline with monitoring"
→ mlops-engineer → ml-engineer → data-engineer → performance-engineer
```

### Integration with Claude Code Commands

For sophisticated multi-agent orchestration, use the [Claude Code Commands](https://github.com/wshobson/commands) collection which provides 52 pre-built slash commands:

```
/full-stack-feature   # Coordinates 8+ agents for complete feature development
/incident-response    # Activates incident management workflow
/ml-pipeline         # Sets up end-to-end ML infrastructure
/security-hardening  # Implements security best practices across stack
```

## Subagent Format

Each subagent is defined as a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Activation criteria for this subagent
model: haiku|sonnet|opus  # Optional: Model selection
tools: tool1, tool2       # Optional: Tool restrictions
---

System prompt defining the subagent's expertise and behavior
```

### Model Selection Criteria

- **haiku**: Simple, deterministic tasks with minimal reasoning
- **sonnet**: Standard development and engineering tasks
- **opus**: Complex analysis, architecture, and critical operations

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Processing
Agents execute in sequence, passing context forward:
```
backend-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor
```

### Parallel Execution
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects:
```
performance-engineer + database-optimizer → Merged analysis
```

### Conditional Routing
Dynamic agent selection based on analysis:
```
debugger → [backend-architect | frontend-developer | devops-troubleshooter]
```

### Validation Pipeline
Primary work followed by specialized review:
```
payment-integration → security-auditor → Validated implementation
```

## Best Practices

### Task Delegation
1. **Automatic selection** - Let Claude Code analyze context and select optimal agents
2. **Clear requirements** - Specify constraints, tech stack, and quality standards
3. **Trust specialization** - Each agent is optimized for their specific domain

### Multi-Agent Workflows
1. **High-level requests** - Allow agents to coordinate complex multi-step tasks
2. **Context preservation** - Ensure agents have necessary background information
3. **Integration review** - Verify how different agents' outputs work together

### Explicit Control
1. **Direct invocation** - Specify agents when you need particular expertise
2. **Strategic combination** - Use multiple specialists for validation
3. **Review patterns** - Request specific review workflows (e.g., "security-auditor reviews API design")

### Performance Optimization
1. **Monitor effectiveness** - Track which agents work best for your use cases
2. **Iterative refinement** - Use agent feedback to improve requirements
3. **Complexity matching** - Align task complexity with agent capabilities

## Contributing

To add a new subagent:

1. Create a new `.md` file with appropriate frontmatter
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated naming convention
3. Write clear activation criteria in the description
4. Define comprehensive system prompt with expertise areas

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Activating
- Ensure request clearly indicates the domain
- Be specific about task type and requirements
- Use explicit invocation if automatic selection fails

### Unexpected Agent Selection
- Provide more context about tech stack
- Include specific requirements in request
- Use direct agent naming for precise control

### Conflicting Recommendations
- Normal behavior - specialists have different priorities
- Request reconciliation between specific agents
- Consider trade-offs based on project requirements

### Missing Context
- Include background information in requests
- Reference previous work or patterns
- Provide project-specific constraints
