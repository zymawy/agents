## Usage

### Agent Invocation

After installing plugins, agents are automatically available. Invoke them explicitly in natural language:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

Claude Code automatically selects and coordinates the appropriate agents based on your request.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Examples

Plugins provide pre-configured multi-agent workflows that coordinate complex operations:

**Full-Stack Development Plugin**
```
"Implement user dashboard with real-time analytics"
```
→ backend-architect → graphql-architect → frontend-developer → mobile-developer → test-automator → security-auditor → performance-engineer → deployment-engineer

**Security Hardening Plugin**
```
"Perform security audit and implement OWASP best practices"
```
→ security-auditor → backend-security-coder → frontend-security-coder → mobile-security-coder → test-automator

**Data/ML Pipeline Plugin**
```
"Build customer churn prediction model with deployment"
```
→ data-scientist → data-engineer → ml-engineer → mlops-engineer → ai-engineer → performance-engineer

**Incident Response Plugin**
```
"Debug production memory leak and create runbook"
```
→ incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → debugger → error-detective → observability-engineer

## Architecture & Design Principles

### Version 1.0.5 Refactoring

This marketplace has been extensively refactored following industry best practices from VSCode, npm, and Chrome extension ecosystems:

#### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each plugin does **one thing well** (Unix philosophy)
- Clear, focused purposes (describable in 5-7 words)
- Average plugin size: **6.2 components** (down from 8-10)
- **Zero bloated plugins** (all under 12 components)

#### Focused Plugin Architecture
- **27 plugins → 36 plugins** (+33% more focused)
- Extracted common functionality: `data-validation-suite`, `deployment-orchestration`
- Split bloated plugins into specialized ones:
  - `infrastructure-devops` (22) → `kubernetes-operations`, `docker-containerization`, `deployment-orchestration`
  - `security-hardening` (18) → `security-scanning`, `security-compliance`, `backend-api-security`, `frontend-mobile-security`
  - `data-ml-pipeline` (17) → `data-engineering`, `machine-learning-ops`, `ai-agent-development`
  - `api-development-kit` (17) → `api-scaffolding`, `api-testing-observability`, `data-validation-suite`
  - `incident-response` (16) → `incident-diagnostics`, `observability-monitoring`

#### Aggressive File Optimization
- **24,392 lines eliminated** (58% reduction in problematic files)
- **10 high-priority files optimized** (62% average reduction)
- **8 legacy monolithic files archived** (14,698 lines)
- Removed redundant examples, consolidated code blocks, streamlined documentation
- All tools remain **fully functional** with zero breaking changes

#### Performance Improvements
- **2-3x faster loading times** (average file size reduced by 58%)
- **Better context window utilization** (tools avg 626 lines vs 954 lines)
- **Improved LLM response quality** (smaller, more focused tools)
- **Lower token costs** (less content to process)

#### Quality Metrics
- ✅ **223 component references validated** (0 broken)
- ✅ **12.6% tool duplication** (minimal and intentional)
- ✅ **100% naming compliance** (kebab-case standard)
- ✅ **90.5% component coverage** (high utilization)

### Design Philosophy

**Composability Over Bundling**
- Mix and match plugins based on needs
- Workflow orchestrators compose focused plugins
- No forced feature bundling

**Context Efficiency**
- Smaller tools = faster processing
- Better fit in LLM context windows
- More accurate, focused responses

**Maintainability**
- Single-purpose = easier updates
- Clear boundaries = isolated changes
- Less duplication = simpler maintenance

**Discoverability**
- Clear plugin names convey purpose
- Logical categorization
- Easy to find the right tool


## Contributing

To add new agents, workflows, or tools:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate directory with frontmatter
2. Use lowercase, hyphen-separated naming convention
3. Write clear activation criteria in the description
4. Define comprehensive system prompt with expertise areas

### Subagent Format

Each subagent is defined as a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Activation criteria for this subagent
model: haiku|sonnet|opus  # Optional: Model selection
tools: tool1, tool2       # Optional: Tool restrictions
---

System prompt defining the subagent's expertise and behavior
```

### Model Selection Criteria

- **haiku**: Simple, deterministic tasks with minimal reasoning
- **sonnet**: Standard development and engineering tasks
- **opus**: Complex analysis, architecture, and critical operations
