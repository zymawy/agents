[![Run in Smithery](https://smithery.ai/badge/skills/wshobson)](https://smithery.ai/skills?ns=wshobson&utm_source=github&utm_medium=badge)

> **🎯 Agent Skills Enabled** — 146 specialized skills extend Claude's capabilities across plugins with progressive disclosure

A comprehensive production-ready system combining **112 specialized AI agents**, **16 multi-agent workflow orchestrators**, **146 agent skills**, and **79 development tools** organized into **72 focused, single-purpose plugins** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

## Overview

This unified repository provides everything needed for intelligent automation and multi-agent orchestration across modern software development:

- **72 Focused Plugins** - Granular, single-purpose plugins optimized for minimal token usage and composability
- **112 Specialized Agents** - Domain experts with deep knowledge across architecture, languages, infrastructure, quality, data/AI, documentation, business operations, and SEO
- **146 Agent Skills** - Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure for specialized expertise
- **16 Workflow Orchestrators** - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex operations like full-stack development, security hardening, ML pipelines, and incident response
- **79 Development Tools** - Optimized utilities including project scaffolding, security scanning, test automation, and infrastructure setup

### Key Features

- **Granular Plugin Architecture**: 72 focused plugins optimized for minimal token usage
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: 79 development tools including test generation, scaffolding, and security scanning
- **100% Agent Coverage**: All plugins include specialized agents
- **Agent Skills**: 146 specialized skills following for progressive disclosure and token efficiency
- **Clear Organization**: 23 categories with 1-6 plugins each for easy discovery
- **Efficient Design**: Average 3.4 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)

### How It Works

Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:

- **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
- **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
- **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
- **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated

**Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 16 skills available (~1000 tokens), not the entire marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
```

This makes all 72 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Install the plugins you need:

```bash
# Essential development plugins
/plugin install python-development          # Python with 16 specialized skills
/plugin install javascript-typescript       # JS/TS with 4 specialized skills
/plugin install backend-development         # Backend APIs with 3 architecture skills

# Infrastructure & operations
/plugin install kubernetes-operations       # K8s with 4 deployment skills
/plugin install cloud-infrastructure        # AWS/Azure/GCP with 4 cloud skills

# Security & quality
/plugin install security-scanning           # SAST with security skill
/plugin install comprehensive-review       # Multi-perspective code analysis

# Full-stack orchestration
/plugin install full-stack-orchestration   # Multi-agent workflows
```

Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents, commands, and skills** into Claude's context.

### Plugins vs Agents

You install **plugins**, which bundle agents:

| Plugin                  | Agents                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `comprehensive-review`  | architect-review, code-reviewer, security-auditor |
| `javascript-typescript` | javascript-pro, typescript-pro                    |
| `python-development`    | python-pro, django-pro, fastapi-pro               |
| `blockchain-web3`       | blockchain-developer                              |

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - can't install agents directly
/plugin install typescript-pro

# ✅ Right - install the plugin
/plugin install javascript-typescript@claude-code-workflows
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Plugin not found"** → Use plugin names, not agent names. Add `@claude-code-workflows` suffix.

**Plugins not loading** → Clear cache and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-code-workflows && rm ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

### Three-Tier Model Strategy

Strategic model assignment for optimal performance and cost:

| Tier       | Model    | Agents | Use Case                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1** | Opus 4.6 | 42     | Critical architecture, security, ALL code review, production coding (language pros, frameworks) |
| **Tier 2** | Inherit  | 42     | Complex tasks - user chooses model (AI/ML, backend, frontend/mobile, specialized)               |
| **Tier 3** | Sonnet   | 51     | Support with intelligence (docs, testing, debugging, network, API docs, DX, legacy, payments)   |
| **Tier 4** | Haiku    | 18     | Fast operational tasks (SEO, deployment, simple docs, sales, content, search)                   |

**Why Opus 4.6 for Critical Agents?**

- 80.8% on SWE-bench (industry-leading)
- 65% fewer tokens for complex tasks
- Best for architecture decisions and security audits

**Tier 2 Flexibility (`inherit`):**
Agents marked `inherit` use your session's default model, letting you balance cost and capability:

- Set via `claude --model opus` or `claude --model sonnet` when starting a session
- Falls back to Sonnet 4.6 if no default specified
- Perfect for frontend/mobile developers who want cost control
- AI/ML engineers can choose Opus for complex model work

**Cost Considerations:**

- **Opus 4.6**: $5/$25 per million input/output tokens - Premium for critical work
- **Sonnet 4.6**: $3/$15 per million tokens - Balanced performance/cost
- **Haiku 4.5**: $1/$5 per million tokens - Fast, cost-effective operations
- Opus's 65% token reduction on complex tasks often offsets higher rate
- Use `inherit` tier to control costs for high-volume use cases

Orchestration patterns combine models for efficiency:

```
Opus (architecture) → Sonnet (development) → Haiku (deployment)
```
