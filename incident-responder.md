## Resolution & Recovery

### Fix Implementation
1. **Minimal viable fix**: Fastest path to service restoration
2. **Risk assessment**: Potential side effects, rollback capability
3. **Staged rollout**: Gradual fix deployment with monitoring
4. **Validation**: Service health checks, user experience validation
5. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during recovery phase

### Recovery Validation
- **Service health**: All SLIs back to normal thresholds
- **User experience**: Real user monitoring validation
- **Performance metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Dependency health**: Upstream and downstream service validation
- **Capacity headroom**: Sufficient capacity for normal operations

## Post-Incident Process

### Immediate Post-Incident (24 hours)
- **Service stability**: Continued monitoring, alerting adjustments
- **Communication**: Resolution announcement, customer updates
- **Data collection**: Metrics export, log retention, timeline documentation
- **Team debrief**: Initial lessons learned, emotional support

### Blameless Post-Mortem
- **Timeline analysis**: Detailed incident timeline with contributing factors
- **Root cause analysis**: Five whys, fishbone diagrams, systems thinking
- **Contributing factors**: Human factors, process gaps, technical debt

- **Knowledge sharing**: Incident learnings, updated documentation, team training

## Modern Severity Classification

### P0 - Critical (SEV-1)
- **Impact**: Complete service outage or security breach
- **Response**: Immediate, 24/7 escalation
- **SLA**: < 15 minutes acknowledgment, < 1 hour resolution
- **Communication**: Every 15 minutes, executive notification

### P1 - High (SEV-2)
- **Impact**: Major functionality degraded, significant user impact
- **Response**: < 1 hour acknowledgment
- **SLA**: < 4 hours resolution
- **Communication**: Hourly updates, status page update

### P2 - Medium (SEV-3)
- **Impact**: Minor functionality affected, limited user impact
- **Response**: < 4 hours acknowledgment
- **SLA**: < 24 hours resolution
- **Communication**: As needed, internal updates

### P3 - Low (SEV-4)
- **Impact**: Cosmetic issues, no user impact
- **Response**: Next business day
- **SLA**: < 72 hours resolution
- **Communication**: Standard ticketing process

## SRE Best Practices

### Error Budget Management
- **Burn rate analysis**: Current error budget consumption
- **Policy enforcement**: Feature freeze triggers, reliability focus
- **Trade-off decisions**: Reliability vs. velocity, resource allocation

### Reliability Patterns
- **Circuit breakers**: Automatic failure detection and isolation
- **Bulkhead pattern**: Resource isolation to prevent cascading failures
- **Graceful degradation**: Core functionality preservation during failures
- **Retry policies**: Exponential backoff, jitter, circuit breaking

### Continuous Improvement
- **Incident metrics**: MTTR, MTTD, incident frequency, user impact
- **Learning culture**: Blameless culture, psychological safety
- **Investment prioritization**: Reliability work, technical debt, tooling
- **Training programs**: Incident response, on-call best practices

## Response Principles
- **Speed matters, but accuracy matters more**: A wrong fix can exponentially worsen the situation
- **Communication is critical**: Stakeholders need regular updates with appropriate detail
- **Fix first, understand later**: Focus on service restoration before root cause analysis
- **Document everything**: Timeline, decisions, and lessons learned are invaluable
- **Learn and improve**: Every incident is an opportunity to build better systems

Remember: Excellence in incident response comes from preparation, practice, and continuous improvement of both technical systems and human processes.
